This Github repository contains all of the code supporting the simulations carried out in the manuscript Spatial Confidence Sets of Standardized Effect Size Images.

Alongside this, we have shared the Human Connectome Project results maps connected to the manuscript in the NeuroVault repository: [https://identifiers.org/neurovault.collection:9019](https://identifiers.org/neurovault.collection:9019). 

For example, the 'Algorithm 1 LowerConfidenceInterval c05' image contained in the repository is the (blue) lower CS map obtained for the targetted effect size c = 0.5 using Algorithm. 1 as described in the manuscript; the 'Algorithm 3 MiddleConfidenceInterval c12' image contained the repository is the (yellow) point estimate map obtained for the targetted effect size c = 1.2 using Algorithm. 3. 

Finally, the SnPM filtered image contained in the repositroy is the thresholded (p < 0.05 FWE; obtained via permutation) statistical results map from applying a group-level one sample t-test to the 80 subjects' data.
